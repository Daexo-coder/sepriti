            <p class="abt">A self-dedicated, hardworking soul that is always eager to learn in every field he
                undergoes.<br>
                My love from refereeing developed 3 years ago at the age of 16. Many people were curious<br> why a very
                young talented lad like me would leave playing soccer and go for a very risky career like Refereeing.<br>
                My story begins from loving money, yeah! life is money! caz yeah! From development to being a
                professional player,<br>it takes probably 12 years to earn a living from it while in refereeing, from the
                first match<br>
                you earn. That's one of the reasons i opted Refereeing.<br>

                Naturally, i am an argumentative person. I personaly would have liked to be a jugde just that life would
                put<br>
                you where it wants. Refereeing is a great career to live myself,arguments, judgements! You get to fairly
                judge situations and incidents.<br>

             My LOVE for money did not allow me end there, it saw me developing other external habits and<br>
             pursuading CAR AGENCY.
